By assessing the fund based on 5 and 10 year investment terms we where able to identify the following:

# SYNOPSIS
Based on the above assessment the best return on the funds invested remains set at 30 years. The tean year investment range on the low end is comprable to the 30 year low but the difference in time  yields a far greater return on high end. Whilst looking at the 5 year term the return on investment is not advisable considering the level of risk of potential loss at the low end.
