The answer is simple - keyboard shortcuts.  You may not have needed them before - but in coding, they'll be one of your new best friends.  Check out these keyboard shortcut cheatsheets to help you get started:

<summary>Why do I need a virtual environment?</summary>

Virtual environments can be compared to different user profiles on one computer. You might share a computer in your home with your family, but you might not have the same programs installed as your 5 year old son, or the same bookmarked pages as your teenaged daughter. When you are ready to the use the computer, you simply log in and all your personal settings are there waiting for you.

In a similar way, virtual environments create a personalized space for your project within your computer.  For example, you might be working on a project with your group during project week that needs certain packages that you don't typically need in the everyday course of class.  You also notice that one of the necessary packages doesn't work with your version of Python and you need a downgraded version.  You would create a virtual environment to download only the packages needed for the project and could set that virtual environment to run the needed version of Python.  Because of your virtual environment you won't need to downgrade your Python package across the board, but only for the project you need it for.

Another important reason for using virtual environments is for deployment purposes. If you have an application you wish to deploy, you wouldn't want unneeded code packages installed with it. This will slow down the application and cause deployment errors.  Having a virtual environment will self contain only what is needed for the application.
